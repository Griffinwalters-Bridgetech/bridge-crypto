# Glossary

This glossary exists to reduce misinterpretation.  
Terms are defined **operationally**, not rhetorically.

---

## Invocation

The act of submitting a transaction, proposal, message, or request to a system.

Invocation means *"this action is possible to consider."*  
It does **not** mean the action should occur.

---

## Execution

The irreversible application of a state change.

Execution is where risk materializes.  
In crypto, execution is final.

---

## Validation

The process by which a system determines that an invocation satisfies syntactic, cryptographic, and rule-based requirements.

Validation answers: *"Is this allowed?"*  
It does **not** answer: *"Is this correct to perform?"*

---

## Non-Execution (Terminal State)

A state in which an invocation does not proceed to execution **and is considered complete**, not failed.

Non-execution under IIC is not delay, rejection, or error.  
It is a **correct outcome**.

---

## Invariant

A property a system must maintain to remain itself.

Invariants are not policies or rules.  
They define what the system *is*, not what it *does*.

---

## Inertial Integrity Constraint (IIC)

A pre-execution invariant stating:

> **Invocation does not imply obligation to execute.**

IIC constrains assumptions, not capabilities.

---

## Governance

Mechanisms that govern **how execution occurs** once it is underway  
(e.g., voting thresholds, quorum, authorization paths).

Governance does not determine whether execution should be assumed.

---

## RED / YELLOW / GREEN (Stoplight Model)

- **GREEN** — execution is appropriate; IIC remains dormant  
- **YELLOW** — ambiguity exists; IIC is latent  
- **RED** — high risk, irreversibility, or sovereignty concerns; IIC becomes salient  

RED does **not** force stopping.  
RED revokes the assumption that continuation is correct.

---

## Attestation

An explicit acknowledgment by authorized actors that execution should proceed **despite** IIC being salient.

Attestation is not enforcement logic.  
It is an explicit completion of the remaining .03.

---

## Momentum-by-Default

The implicit assumption that once an action is valid, continuation is virtuous.

IIC exists to revoke this assumption in irreversible systems.

---

*Bridge — governing execution before it becomes irreversible.*
